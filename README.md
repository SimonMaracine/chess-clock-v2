# Chess Clock V2

Two years ago I made from scratch, together with a friend, a chess clock. We
used an Arduino Uno and some bought parts, like buttons, wires, an LCD screen
and other things like that, but everything else was made by us, including the
case and the internal wiring with a handmade PCB.

This time we would like to improve everything: the software, the case, the
wiring, the buttons and everything else.
